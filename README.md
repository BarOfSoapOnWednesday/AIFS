# AI From Scratch
AI from Scratch is a lecture series run by [Hessian AI Labs](https://www.hessianailabs.com.au) in association with the AI for Society (AIFS), Sydney chapter. The goal is to up-skill or re-skill the workforce to empower them with the capability to leverage the power of data and AI.
Lectures: Wed 8-9pm and Sun 10-12am AEST, Google Hangouts

This is a long running course that is focused on building up concepts and ideas, including the necessary math, *from scratch*. Initially, we'll focus on covering only the bare minimum math necessary for Machine Learning. Further to this, the math is developed as and when required. Course structure is as follows:

1. Mathematical Background
   * Set theory, Numbers, Spaces
   * Linear Algebra Fundamentals
   * Probability and Statistics
   * Information Theory
   * Calculus
2. Machine Learning
   * Linear Models
   * Non-linear Models (Neural Networks)
   * Kernel Methods
   * Graphical Models
   * Latent Variable Models
   * Approximate Inference and Sampling
   * Dimensionality Reduction 
3. Deep Learning
   * Visual data based models
     * CNN etc.
   * Sequential data based models
     * RNN etc.
   * Generative models
     * VAE, GAN etc.
