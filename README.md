# AI From Scratch
AI from Scratch is a 2hr weekly AI session run by the AI for Society (AIFS), Sydney chapter. The goal is to up-skill and/or re-skill the workforce to empower them with the capability to leverage the power of data and AI. 

This is a long running course that is focused on building up concepts and ideas, including the necessary math, from scratch. We focus on covering only the bare minimum math necessary for Machine Learning. Further to this, the math is developed as and when required. Course structure is as follows:

1. Mathematical Background
   * Set theory, Numbers, Spaces
   * Linear Algebra Fundamentals
   * Probability and Statistics
   * Information Theory
   * Calculus
2. Machine Learning
   * Linear Models
   * Non-linear Models (Neural Networks)
   * Kernel Methods
   * Graphical Models
   * Latent Variable Models
   * Approximate Inference and Sampling
   * Dimensionality Reduction 
3. Deep Learning
   * Visual data based models
     * CNN etc.
   * Sequential data based models
     * RNN etc.
   * Generative models
     * VAE, GAN etc.
