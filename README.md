# AI From Scratch
AI from Scratch is a lecture series run by [Hessian AI Labs](https://www.hessianailabs.com.au) in association with the AI for Society (AIFS), Sydney chapter. The goal is to up-skill or re-skill the workforce to empower them with the capability to leverage the power of data and AI.
### Lectures:

This is a long running course that is focused on building up concepts and ideas, including the necessary math, *from scratch*. Initially, we'll focus on building the intuition for Machine Learning while developing the math in parallel. Course structure is as follows:

1. Machine Learning Basics
   * Introduction to Learning Algorithms
   * Foundational ML concepts
2. Machine Learning Algorithms
   * Linear Models
   * Non-linear Models (Neural Networks)
   * Kernel Methods
   * Graphical Models
   * Latent Variable Models
   * Approximate Inference and Sampling
   * Dimensionality Reduction
3. Deep Learning
   * Visual data based models
     * CNN etc.
   * Sequential data based models
     * RNN etc.
   * Generative models
     * VAE, GAN etc.
